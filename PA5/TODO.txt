Things we still need to have/do:

1. Some kind of 2D hashmap that given a class name and an attribute name, returns the attribute index
(like if color is the first attribute in a class called crayon, it should return 1,
or if length is the second attribute in a class called crayton, it should return 2)
*return -1 if hashmap returns null

Why do we need this? It is used in code generation in expressions like Object (cool-tree.java)

2. Some way to get the offset of a variable that is in scope. (Look at Object again in cool-tree.java to see what I mean)
   Basically there are local variables in a given activation frame so if a local variable is the 1st argument/variable
   in the frame then maybe a hashmap that takes in this variable name will return 1, or -1 if variable not in frame

3. Finish up parentTab attrTabTab (will make case expression easier to handle) (THIS IS DONE)

4. Finish up any unimplemented expressions in cool-tree.java

5. Fix up code for init, attribute, and method (in CgenNode). I think it still might be slightly wrong?

6. Write tests

7. Write README


======Questions and Follow up======
Are we allowed to change the method prototype in cool-tree.java? (i.e. code(PrintStream) to code(PrintStream, CgenClassTable))
